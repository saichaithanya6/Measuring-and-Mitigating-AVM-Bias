### AVM(Automated Valuation Model)
Typically, a home is assessed for its value either by a human appraiser or by using an automated valuation model (AVM). Human appraiser bias is a risk, as a multitude of anecdotes and recent research attests to 
the systemic injustice in the home appraisal process and the harms appraisal bias causes. Multiple news reports suggest that Black homeowners often feel they must “whitewash” their property by removing all 
evidence of their racial background to get a fair valuation.


### Problem
Test an AVM for racial bias in model outcomes, quantify the size of the bias, if any, identify model features that drive the bias, and describe potential societal harms that can result from this bias
